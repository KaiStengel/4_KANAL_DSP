# 4 Channel DSP
This is a project based on the ESP32 modul. Combine it with two pcm1802 and two pcm5102a or other similar i2s dac/adc to get 4 input and output channels with 24bit depth and a sample rate of 96kHz. You can use iir filters to do equalization and all stuff you would want to do with it. 

## Capablilitys
Rout, change volume and equalize 4 seperate audio channels.
There is a fuction which can be used to convert stereo signal into 3/4 signals for 2.1 or 2.2 speaker systems.

## Bluetooth Coming Soon
It is planed to use bluetooth a2dp as a audio source.

## Wifi Coming Soon
It is planed to use Wifi to be able to controll and change settings like eq.
